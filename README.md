<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Wilson Gramer!</h1>

<p align="center">I'm a passionate student developer currently working at <a href="https://mk-dir.com/">Make Directory</a>. I'm mainly interested in devops and backend programming, and work primarily with Swift, TypeScript, Rust and Go. Check out what I’ve been building recently:</p>

- <img height=24 src="https://gramer.dev/images/wipple.svg" alt="Wipple Logo"> **Wipple** ([wipplelang/wipple](https://github.com/wipplelang/wipple)) • Programming language for building DSLs that’s natural to read, write and learn. I’m building Wipple to learn how programming languages work, and plan to use it on my robotics team.

- <img height=24 src="https://gramer.dev/images/superhomework.png" alt="Wipple Logo"> **SuperHomework** ([superhomeworkapp.com](https://superhomeworkapp.com)) • Automatically organize your homework — just sign in with your school accounts and SuperHomework automatically fetches the latest assignments for you. With reminder notifications and widgets, you’ll never forget your homework again.

- <img height=24 src="https://gramer.dev/images/retailbox.png" alt="Wipple Logo"> **RetailBox** ([retailbox.app](https://retailbox.app)) • Home to over 150 high-quality screen savers from places around the world. Use RetailBox to showcase your device for content creation, in stores and more. We add new content every month, with no ads.

I also write about programming on my website, [gramer.dev](https://gramer.dev). I love open source — check out [AppleWelcomeScreen](https://github.com/WilsonGramer/AppleWelcomeScreen), [storage](https://github.com/WilsonGramer/storage) and [Tyngsborough Robotics](https://github.com/tyngsboroughrobotics)!
